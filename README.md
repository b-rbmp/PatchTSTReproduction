### Description
This repository contains code that attempts to replicate the results from the paper:

**A Time Series is Worth 64 Words: Long-term Forecasting with Transformers**  
Yuqi Nie, Nam H. Nguyen, Phanwadee Sinthong, Jayant Kalagnanam  
*The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2023*  
[Paper Link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Jbdc0vTOcol)

The implementation aims to reproduce the proposed PatchTST architecture and evaluate its performance on long-term time series forecasting tasks.
